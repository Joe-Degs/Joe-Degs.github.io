Hey 👋🏿  Joe here!

__TLDR__

*This is a blog for beginners by a beginner having fun learning how computers
work by interacting with them and occassionally going off on a tangential rant
about how frustrating they are...* Cheers 🥂

__The Long Bit__

I am a student in the University studying Rural and Urban Planning until I 
discovered how fun computers actually are.
I am still studying Planning (and can't wait to finish) but I spend all of my
time learning to write computer programs and about how computers actually work.
I'm hoping to make this little obsession of mine into a career, but no rushing okay...
let's continue the fun for now!

I am mostly engaged in things relating to networked computer infrastructure, so
I dabble in a little network programming, OS specific programming (systems
programming) and any other thing that interests me. I do my OS specific
programming (systems programming) on __Linux__. I do not have a thing you know,
a lot of things fascinate me day in day out and I'm just taking my time to
take it all in.

So yeah, join me for this fun ride will yah. We are going to have soo much fun!

~ Joe
